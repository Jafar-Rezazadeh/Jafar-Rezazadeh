## Hi there 👋

I'm Jafar (jafar.rzzd) — a Flutter developer based in Tabriz, Iran with 2–3 years of experience building cross-platform mobile applications.

I focus on creating maintainable and scalable apps using clean architecture and proven best practices. My main areas of expertise include:

- State management and architecture: GetX (state management, dependency injection, and routing)
- Routing and navigation (including Navigator 2.0 / declarative routing)
- App architecture and project structure (clean architecture, layered designs)
- Working with RESTful APIs, networking, JSON serialization, and WebSocket integrations
- Platform integration: calling native code with Kotlin and C++ (platform channels / FFI)
- High-performance UI: CustomPaint / CustomPainters for expensive widgets and fine-grained rendering control
- Testing-driven development (TDD), with emphasis on unit testing and testable architecture
- Performance tuning, debugging, and profiling for responsive apps

Professional experience highlight:
- Worked at a company that maintained an HR system; I built a mobile app that integrated with parts of that system via REST APIs and WebSocket connections.
