## Hi there 👋

I'm Jafar (jafar.rzzd) — a Flutter developer based in Tabriz, Iran with 2–3 years of experience building cross-platform mobile applications.

I focus on creating maintainable and scalable apps using clean architecture and best practices. My main areas of expertise include:

- State management (Provider, Riverpod, BLoC, GetX)
- Routing and navigation (including Navigator 2.0 / declarative routing)
- App architecture and project structure (clean architecture, layered designs)
- Working with RESTful APIs, networking, and JSON serialization
- Testing, debugging, and improving app performance

I'm open to collaboration, contributing to interesting projects, and new opportunities. Feel free to explore my repositories to see my work or reach out via GitHub.
